====== Patching guide ====== 

This folder root is equivalent to the kernel root (i. e. kernel/goldfish), 
and all added and modified files are put in their folder respectively.

You may use this to apply this patch folder (which is <patch-root>) to the
original kernel folder (which is <orig-kernel-root>):

	cp -r --remove-destination <patch-root>/* <orig-kernel-root>
	
Or use the Makefile in the root folder as instructed.
